# Introduction

This repository contains the [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) setup for the Redhouse 
box. 

The Redhouse box is a Vagrant box setup to develop Ruby projects based on the 
[Laravel Homestead](https://github.com/laravel/homestead) project which fulfills that 
role for PHP projects. 

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to Vagrant, Homestead and the related 
projects to make the lives of many developers a great deal easier!

## Getting started

To get started simply copy the readhouse.yaml.sample file to readhouse.yaml and modify 
it to your liking. Once you're done editing run 'vagrant up' and wait for the 
provisioning to complete.
